# Task-management
The project entails the development of an advanced task management program for a small business. The program employs functions for enhanced modularity and incorporates features for user interaction, task assignment, tracking, and reporting. Users can log in, register new users (admin-only), add tasks, and view tasks assigned to them or all tasks. The addition of functions enhances code structure, including functions such as 'reg_user' for user registration and 'add_task' for task addition. A refined 'view_mine' function allows users to select and edit tasks, marking them as complete or modifying details, provided they are not completed. The admin menu encompasses options to generate comprehensive reports. These reports, saved in 'task_overview.txt' and 'user_overview.txt', offer insights such as task completion statistics, overdue tasks, user-specific task breakdowns, and user engagement metrics. The admin can access these reports within the program for a user-friendly overview of task and user performance.
